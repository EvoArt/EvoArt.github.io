# The Ecological Detective

Here I will be working through [The Ecological Detective](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691034973/the-ecological-detective), by Ray HilBorn and Marc Mangel. These pages won't have much text. All the text is in the book. This is just for implementation (Julia code) details.
